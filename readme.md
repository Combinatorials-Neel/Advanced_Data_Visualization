## About

Advanced Data Visualization NEEL is coded in Python code with a Jupyter Notebook provided by Institut Néel. The package used to visualize and manipulate the data with python commands. A tool (DaHU) is already provided to quickly visualize the data. However, this Notebook is provided to extract data into xarrays to do more advanced analysis.

You can contact me for any issues at william.rigaut@neel.cnrs.fr

Available on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Requires Python 3.8+.


## Getting Started

You will need a recent version of python (3.8 or higher) in order to run the python code
Installing Jupyter Notebook is also highly recommanded since a detail tutorial is provided.

Then you will need to create a new python environnement to import the required libraries,
you can do that with the following command in a terminal:
    `python3 -m venv .venv`
and then:
    `source .venv/bin/activate`
Finally to import all the libraries:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once the installation is done, you can open the Notebook `Advanced Data Visualization NEEL.ipynb`
No example dataset is provided, contact me if you need an example.
For MaMMoS partners, HDF5 datasets are provided on Keeper.
